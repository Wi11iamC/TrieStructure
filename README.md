# Trie

This is another project (Data Structures) to implement a tree structure / prefix tree.

User can make a .txt file with a list of words to be inserted into the Trie.

THe program will display the Trie after compiling. 

User would also be able to search for words in the Trie (completion list for a prefix).

To run / test:

compile:
```sh
make all
```
Then run,
```sh
make run
```
